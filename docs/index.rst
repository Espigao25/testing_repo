What is SoundGen:
=================

| SoundGen is a flexible burst mode ASK signal demodulator and frame processer, created with DVB-T in mind. For a larger contextualization consult the thesis this document is annexed to.
|
| This software couples an easy setup with the advantage of the flexible tuning mechanism included in the SDR kit. It includes the possibility of network integration.
| The script has been tested only for scenarios where an emitter is transmitting ASK encoded frames in bursts, spaced by periods of silence, with constant distinct RF power levels for different symbols.
| This user guide is oriented towards the final user, if you are a developer who wishes to contribute please read the master thesis associated with this project. Furthermore, all the details in this document assume you have a working with a clone of the master SD card.

Example:

Demodulating a signal with a 5kHz symbol rate riding on a 95MHz carrier wave is as simple as::

 python3 SoundGen.py -f 95000000 -sym 5000

.. _here: https://gitlab.com/diogobatista/soundgen_python

The code repository can be found here_ .

How to setup
--------------

1. First of all, install all the dependencies. This step is only necessary if you have not been provided with a cloned microSD card.

  - PyLab
  - RtlSdr
  - argparse
  - numpy
  - matplotlib


2. Connect the receiver/SDR kit to your RPI via USB, remember to use an adequate antenna to the carrier wave you intend to sniff.

  | Run rtl_test on the command line to check if the kit was properly detected and no warnings or errors were returned.

3. Make sure you are on the project's root folder. It should be located at ""$/SoundGen_Python/SoundGen_Python/".

How to use
------------

"python3 SoundGen.py -h" on the terminal will give you an updated list of all the arguments you can pass into the script. They are:


+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+
| Argument name | Argument description                                                       | type    |
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+
| -f *          |  Center frequency tuning, should equal the freq of your carrier wave       | int     |
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+
| -sym          |  Symbol rate of expected ASK signal. Defaults to 3650.                     | int     |
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+
| -s            |  Sampling rate. Defaults to 226 000.                                       | int     |
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+
| -ff           |  Size of the internal FIFO. Default value is 5, must be 5 or greater.      | int     |
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+
| -sf           |  Frame size in samples. Defaults to 327 680. Must be a multiple of 512.    | int     |
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+
| -g            |  Software gain, must belong to interval [0 50].                            | int     |
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+
| -it           |  Number of main loop cycles before program exits. Meaningless if -i True.  | int     |
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+
| -i            |  Infinite mode, runs the program indefinitely if True.                     | bool    |
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+
|-db            |  Debug mode, dumps debugging info into three distinct outfiles.            | bool    |
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+
|-cp            |  Which comparator to use, -DEEP -PBZ or -FAST. Defaults to -FAST           | bool    |
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+
|-gen           |  Generate signal internally (True) or use an external input (Default/False)| bool    |
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+
|-h             |  Ignore all other arguments, print this table and exit.                    | None    |
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+

| All arguments marked in the table with an asterisk are mandatory, the remaining are optional and will revert to default values in case no argument is supplied.

| To know the default values type into terminal ::

  python3 SoundGen.py -h

Proper format is::

  python3 SoundGen.py [arg] [value] [arg] [value] ... [arg] [value]

For example, in order to capture a signal with a 10k symbol rate on a 868MHz carrier wave, with debugging mode on and a gain of 10dB, I would type into the terminal::

  python3 SoundGen.py -f 868000000 -sym 10000 -db True -g 10

|



Frame processing
------------------

Not only will this package demodulate ASK frames, it will also process them according to the following packet protocol.

| PREAMBLE + PAYLOAD + CRC + STOP BITS

| Every time a PREAMBLE is detected and the subsequent packet passes the CRC validation, its PAYLOAD field will be added to a list of all the data fields successfully harvested from the current frame.

| At the end of the program execution (or between cycles if infinite mode is turned on), all the PAYLOAD fields in that list will be dumped into a .npy file in the "./outputs/" folder. The user can run the following script in order to read the contents of the outputs folder. ::

  python3 readGen.npy

|  No more than 5 .npy files will ever be in that folder at any given time, if the number exceeds the limit then the oldest one will be overwritten in order to prevent memory bloating.

|  The file's name will be the timestamp of its creation.

|

Network integration
--------------------

| Currently, the easiest way to provide network integration is to remotely access the RPI (see Remote Connection) and harvest the .npy files in "./outputs/" in real time.
| Measures have been taken to prevent concurrency issues. If the file is visible in the folder it means my script will no longer interact with it, ever.

|

Debugging mode
---------------

WARNING: ENABLING INFINITE MODE AND DEBUGGING MODE IN THE SAME EXECUTION IS NOT ADVISABLE.

| When the argument -db is set to 'True', the program will produce three aditional .npy files in parallel to it's normal "./outputs". These files will be placed in the script's root folder. Any debugging files from previous executions of the script still present in the destination folder will be overwritten.
| They contain the following information:

outfile_samples.npy
  A list with all the samples collected during the programs execution. This file can get very big very fast. After a few minutes of continuous execution this will become a major resource hog, it will slowdown the script considerably.

outfile_signal.npy
  A list with the demodulation result of the entire program execution. It will exclusively consist of 1's and 0's. If multiple frames were processed the results will be concatenated into a single list.

outfile_SPB.npy
  A numeric value which equals the ratio: SamplingRate/SymbolRate


Additionally, further debugging tools are available by editing three variables in the source code of the library pdata.py (lines 11-13).
| These will provide you with helpful graphs and timestamps that might help with diagnosing issues or identifying optimization routes.

|

Infinite mode
----------------

WARNING: ENABLING INFINITE MODE AND DEBUGGING MODE IN THE SAME EXECUTION IS NOT ADVISABLE.

Toggle this on if you wish for the program to run in an infinite loop

GPIO
-------


Some GPIO pins are configured for LED control, in order to provide the user with additional real-time feedback.

| This method works only in rigid packet mode. During normal working of the program, output signals will be produced from the RPI. These signals are intended to be used to control leds. Five different leds will be supported. Four of them [leds 1-4] will be indicative of the success rate in receiving expected packets, calculated via number of received packets versus time interval. A fifth led [led 5] will serve as a heartbeat display.

+-------------------+--------------------------------------------+
| # of active leds  |  Sucess rate interval of last iteration    |
+-------------------+--------------------------------------------+
| 0                 |  0-25%                                     |
+-------------------+--------------------------------------------+
| 1                 |  25-50%                                    |
+-------------------+--------------------------------------------+
| 2                 |  50-75%                                    |
+-------------------+--------------------------------------------+
| 3                 |  75-90%                                    |
+-------------------+--------------------------------------------+
| 4                 |  90-100%                                   |
+-------------------+--------------------------------------------+


| All resistances in the following scheme should equal 1kΩ.

Remote connection
---------------------

The main outputs produced by the program are printed via terminal, and therefore are fully compatible with remote SSH connections. FTP is also possible in order to access all the outfiles.
The Raspberry PI will by default create a hotspot called RPI2. The password to connect to the WiFi access point is password123.

.. _PuTTY: https://www.putty.org/
.. _FileZilla: https://filezilla-project.org/

Relevant software: PuTTY_ (SSH) and FileZilla_ (FTP)

.. _tutorial: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/access-point.md

| By default the address the RPI will assign itself will be 192.168.4.1, this can be customized. Here's a good RPI wifi access point tutorial_ .

Once connected to the RPI hotspot:

.. image:: images/putty.png

|

The RPI user credentials are::

  Username: pi
  Password: raspberry

|

Autonomous mode
-----------------


On the RPI's root directory there is shell executable file configured to run on startup (startup.sh), this file can be edited to make the RPI automatically start demodulating upon power on without any necessary user input.
In order to activate this mode the user should edit the file with::

  sudo nano startup.sh

And uncomment the second line of conde, adding input arguments as necessary. (See How to use)
| When all the desired changes are done. Save and close the before rebooting the RPI with::

  sudo restart

In order to deactivate the Autonomous mode, last line of startup.sh must be commented again.


Real time plot generation mode
--------------------------------

The comparators have inbuilt debugging tools. Consult section 4.9 on the attached thesis for more detailed info.


Filter simulation tool
--------------------------------

This package also includes a filter simulation tool as described. It can be found under filterSim.py, this script will import the signal presently stored under outfile_samples.npy. And apply a filter according to the designations under the scripts code. No user interface exists at the moment and the code must be edited directly in order to tweak simulated filter settings.

In order to generate an outfile_samples.npy for this simulator to work with, run SoundGen on debug mode ("-db True" as an argument on the command line) with the filter disabled (line 136 commented in SoundGen.py)


Internal signal generation mode
--------------------------------

If the -gen variable is set to true, the signal will not attempt to locate any SDR kit via USB connection. It will instead internally generate a signal that attempts to match provided settings. Symbol rate and sampling rate ratio will be taken into consideration, and the simulated packets will be according to the structure established on line 60 of SoundGen.py
